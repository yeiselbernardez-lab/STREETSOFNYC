App Overview

Build a mobile-first native web application using React Native with Expo that visually simulates people walking across a New York City street when buttons are clicked.

The app represents “The Streets of New York”, featuring:

A centered layout

A light grey background

A NYC street scene with skyscrapers, small storefronts, and a pedestrian crosswalk

Animated characters that walk from the left side of the screen to the right when triggered by user interaction

The app must work on mobile and web, and be deployable to Vercel using Expo Web.

Requirements
Tech Stack

Expo (latest version)

React Native (functional components + hooks)

Expo Web compatibility

React Native Animated or Reanimated for walking animations

No backend required

Layout

Light grey background

Centered vertical layout

Large, easy-to-read title button centered near the top that reads:
“THE STREETS OF NEW YORK”

NYC street scene below the title:

Crosswalk street spanning full width

Pedestrian walking / stop signs

NYC skyscrapers in the background

Small storefronts (bodega, coffee shop, deli, etc.)

Five character buttons underneath the street

Features
Character System

There are 5 unique character types:

Black woman with afro hair

White woman with blonde hair

Man with afro and big beard

Little light-skin girl with curly hair

Old man with a very long beard and a cane

Each character:

Starts off-screen on the left

Walks smoothly across the street to the right

Uses horizontal translation animation

Has slight vertical bobbing for realism

Button Behavior

Each character has its own button

Every button click:

Spawns a new instance of that character

Triggers a walking animation across the screen

Clicking the same button multiple times:

Continues to add additional walkers

Characters do not overwrite each other

Multiple characters can walk simultaneously

State Management

Track click counts per character type

Use unique IDs for each animated character instance

Remove characters from state after they exit the screen

API (if needed)

No external APIs required

All animations and logic handled locally

Optional: use local SVGs or placeholder illustrations for characters and buildings

Styling

Use StyleSheet.create

Light grey background (#f2f2f2)

Large, high-contrast buttons

Clean, playful, NYC-inspired aesthetic

Street should be visually large enough for walking animations

Fonts should be accessible and mobile-friendly

Characters may be implemented as:

SVGs

PNGs

Or styled React Native Views

Deployment Readiness

Must be compatible with Expo Web

Avoid native-only APIs that break on web

Ready for deployment to Vercel

Include comments or notes explaining:

How to run locally with Expo

How to build for web

How to deploy to Vercel

Output

Deliver:

Fully functional Expo + React Native app

Clean, readable, well-commented code

Organized component structure (e.g. StreetScene, Character, CharacterButton)

Smooth animations

Responsive behavior on mobile and web

Placeholder assets where needed
